In this lab report I am going to demonstrate and show the keys I pressed to make changes and update it to its Github repository all by commands in the terminal
## Step 4

## Step 5

**key pressed:** Then I typed `git clone` and `<tab> follow by `git@github.com:CibyL1226/lab7.git` I copied and pasted using `<ctrl + c> <ctrl + v>`, and I ran it using `<return>`. After I cloned it. I used `ls` to make sure it was cloned to the repository. Then I used `<down><down>` to move the cursor down for the new command.

## Step 6

**key pressed:** I typed in `cd ~/lab7` command to access the lab7 directory to run the tests. I pressed `<return>` then `ls + <return>` to check if I am in the right directory. `<down><down>` and `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` to compile the test file and `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests.java` to run the test. `<return>`

## Step 7

**key pressed:** I access the `ListExample.java` using `vim ListExamples.java` command and `<return>`. I moved down to the last loop by `<j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j><j>`about 44 times because the error is on the 44th line. I moved the cursor to the right six times the line using `<l><l><l><l><l><l>` to get to the error. Next, I used the `<r1>` key to replace 1 with 2. Then I exit and save the changes with `<:wq> + <return>`.
