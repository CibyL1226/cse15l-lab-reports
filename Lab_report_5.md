# Lab Report 5 #
## Part I - Debugging Scenario
This is an attempt to compile the StringServer.java file. 

Below is the command input and errors returned by the terminal:

Here is the EdStem message I used to asked a question to debug the error I am experiencing:

This is the TA response to the question above:

The TA response reminds the student to apply the steps they missed before compiling the file and now they have successfully got into the correcty directory and compile the `StringServer.java` and `Server.java` file.

The edits I did to fixed the bugs were to log into the local server with `ieng6` account and `cd` command into the `stringsearch` directory, then eventually run the command:`javac StringServer.java Server.java`.


## Part II - Reflection
From the lab sections I learned how to run and manipulate web browser output from remote server. I also learned how to navigate through github, which I had no idea how to on my own and wasted a lot of time on trying to figure out all the functions. It was also really helpful to learn how to use bash scripts. I enjoyed learning about the theories behind Gradescope and had a chance to run and create the codes behind these functions we used on a day-to-day basis. Thank you!
